                <h2>Hello World.</h2>
                <p>Hi! I’m Emmelia, an aspiring software developer with a strong foundation in both backend and frontend technologies, currently pursuing my M.S. in Software Development at Boston University. My background includes proficiency in Python, Java, and C++ for backend development, as well as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for frontend projects. I bring practical IT experience from my current role as an IT Technician with Killingly Public Schools, where I’ve honed my problem-solving skills and technical expertise in real-world scenarios.</p>
                <p>In addition to my technical skills, I pride myself on being a dedicated learner and leader. My membership in organizations like the Society of Women Engineers, Girls Who Code, and Rewriting the Code reflects my commitment to fostering diversity and inclusion in tech. I’m also a Merit Scholarship recipient and a President’s List honoree, which demonstrate my academic dedication.</p>
                <p>What sets me apart is my holistic approach—combining technical expertise with strong communication, leadership, and a relentless desire to learn. I’m passionate about contributing to impactful software projects that make a difference and excited to bring my skills and enthusiasm to a forward-thinking team.</p>
